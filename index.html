          It is the study of the physical properties of molecules and molecular
          dynamics. The field overlaps significantly with physical chemistry,
          chemical physics, and quantum chemistry. It is often considered as a
          sub-field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics. Research groups
          studying molecular physics are typically designated as one of these
          other fields. Molecular physics addresses phenomena due to both
          molecular structure and individual atomic processes within molecules.
          Like atomic physics, it relies on a combination of classical and
          quantum mechanics to describe interactions between electromagnetic
          radiation and matter. Experiments in the field often rely heavily on
          techniques borrowed from atomic physics, such as spectroscopy and
          scattering.

        <dd>
          It is a branch of physical chemistry focused on the application of
          quantum mechanics to chemical systems, particularly towards the
          quantum-mechanical calculation of electronic contributions to physical
          and chemical properties of molecules, materials, and solutions at the
          atomic level. These calculations include systematically applied
          approximations intended to make calculations computationally feasible
          while still capturing as much information about important
          contributions to the computed wave functions as well as to observable
          properties such as structures, spectra, and thermodynamic properties.
          Quantum chemistry is also concerned with the computation of quantum
          effects on molecular dynamics and chemical kinetics.

        <dt>Beer</dt>
        <dd>
          It is one of the oldest types of alcoholic drinks in the world, and
          the most widely consumed. It is the third most popular drink overall
          after potable water and tea. It is produced by the brewing and
          fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsâ€”most
          commonly malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are
          also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch
          sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting
          beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and
          other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising
          agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be
          included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural
          carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced
          with forced carbonation.
